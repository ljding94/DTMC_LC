# Dynamical Triangulation Monte Carlo with Liquid Crystal degree of freedom

Bases on Dynamical Triangulation Monte Carlo (DTMC, which use effective energy to model fluid membrane. The DTMC_LC model model the liquid crystalline energy with orientational order on each bead, and add membrane-orientation coupling using tilt energy and effective depletion-like energy.
